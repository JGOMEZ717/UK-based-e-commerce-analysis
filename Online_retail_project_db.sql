-- purpose:
-- to explore customer purchasing behavior, product performance,
-- and sales patterns in an e-commerce setting using transaction level data.

-- approach:
-- cleaned data handled missing values, removed extra columns, standardized columns
-- identify top selling and most returned products
-- analyze total and seasonal revenue trends
-- compare guest vs known customer behavior
-- explore return rates and country-level revenue

-- goal:
-- which products generate the most revenue?
-- are there seasonal spikes in sales?
-- should we encourage guest to customer conversion?
-- which countries contribute most to sales?

-- this query gives you the top 5 products by revenue and their return rates.
-- also had to offset some results because they were misc.
